# Desktop Cleaner with Python

This project is a simple file organizer that uses Python's `os` module to clean up and organize files on your desktop. It categorizes files by their type (images, videos, documents, etc.) and moves them into corresponding folders, making your desktop cleaner and more organized.

## Features

- Organizes files by type (e.g., images, videos, documents, audio).
- Moves each file type into a dedicated folder.
- Creates a folder for all other folders to keep the desktop tidy.
- Easily extendable to support additional file types or custom organization rules.
